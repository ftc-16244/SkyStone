Git Notes

To create a branch:
Can do from remote via Github web page or
git branch nameof branch

Switch to that branch
git checkout nameofbranch

do git add, commits and pushes like normal

when ready to move new code up to master you need to merge.

To merge a branch

go to the branch (in this case it is called "test"

git fetch origin master // this pulls the master into the branch so conflicts can be fixed without messing up master

regular commits seem to get hug up so do git commit -i -m "message" the i adds other files

git merge master // merges the master it to the branch

git push origin test:master //

The first line makes sure he has any upstream commits that have been made to master since the last time updated his local repository.

The second pulls those changes (if any) from master into development

The third pushes the development branch (now fully merged with master) up to origin/master.
